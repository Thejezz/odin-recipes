        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Orange chicken is an American Chinese dish of Hunan origin. The variety of orange chicken most commonly found at North American fast food restaurants consists of chopped, battered, and fried chicken pieces coated in a sweet orange-flavored chili sauce, which thickens or caramelizes to a glaze.</p>
        <p>While the dish is very popular in the United States, it is most often found as a variation of General Tso's rather than the authentic dish found in mainland China.</p>
        <p>In most countries in the western hemisphere, the names "orange chicken", "orange peel chicken", and "tangerine chicken" are typically used for this particular dish. In Chinese, however, the dish is always known as "陈皮鸡", literally "old peel chicken", referring to dried orange or tangerine peel, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine as well as cooking. For restaurants outside of Asia, fresh orange peel is often used instead, or even no peel at all.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups water<li>
            <li>⅓ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated orange zest</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange juice for sauce into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes; bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Reserve the remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on both sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.</li>
            <li>Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth. Stir into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
